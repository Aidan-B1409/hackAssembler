This project accepts a .asm Assembly file, written in the Hack assembler langage, and converts it to binary instructions to be executed by a CPU. 
Written in Java, developed for the OSU-Cascades CS-271 Final Project.

(How To Use)
0) Make sure your system is installed with the latest version of the Java 8 Runtime Executable. 
1) Put your .asm Assembly file into the directory of your Assembler jar file 
2) Open Command Prompt and run the Assembler.jar file with the command 
    java -jar cs271final.jar [fileName.asm]
giving the name of the Assembly file as an argument.
3) Your .hack binary file will be generated in the same directory.
